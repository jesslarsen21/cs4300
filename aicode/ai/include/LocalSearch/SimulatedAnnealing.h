     * The temperature changes each time a neighbor is evaluated by:
     * temperature = temperature - temperature / temperature_reduction
     *
     * If a neighbor is better than the current state, it is selected.
     * If a neighbor is worse than the current state, the probability
     * of the neighbor being seleceted is:
     * probability = exp((neighbor_value - current_value) / temperature)
     *
     * The resolution of the random number selection is controlled by resolution:
     * random = (rand() % resolution) / resolution;

     * start_temperature     =    30.0;
